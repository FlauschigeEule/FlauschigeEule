- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlauschigeEule
- 👀 I’m interested in my new-found passion of Web Development, yoga and exercise in general, backpacking and camping, being outdoors, and reading 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript and am enrolled in CareerFoundry's Web Development bootcamp
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will allow a newbie to practice skills. I would love to, for example, create a JS app
